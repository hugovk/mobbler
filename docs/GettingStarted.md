# Installing Mobbler
Mobbler should be compatible with all S60 3rd edition and 5th edition smartphones.  Please visit the [Compatibility](Compatibility.md) wiki page to see a full list.

Download the mobbler\_x\_x\_x.sisx file on the right and install Mobbler on you phone.  _Please note that if you are upgrading Mobbler, you may need to uninstall your current version before installing again._

You can also download the latest version of Mobbler with a QR code reader pointed at the image below.

If you get a certificate error when installing Mobbler, it probably means that your phone does not accept _self signed_ applications.  You will need to go to the application manager on your phone and change the software installation setting from _signed only_ to _all_.
